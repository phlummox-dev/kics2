Curry Front End
===============

This directory contains a front end (lexer, parser, type checker etc)
for the programming language Curry.
It is used in the Curry distributions PAKCS and KiCS2.

The front end translates a Curry program into various
intermediate formats, like FlatCurry (used for program analyzers
and back ends), AbstractCurry (used for program manipulation tools),
or HTML (used for program documentation).
